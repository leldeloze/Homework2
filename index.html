            <p>If you have kids, or have kids on the way, having a pet at a young age can lower their risk of
                getting
                allergies. Not only to pet hair, but according to the National Institute of Health, pet exposure at
                a
                young
                age can also prevent "other types of common allergies, such as allergy to dust mites, ragweed, and
                grass."
                Cats can have a bunch of positive effects on children. According to Care.com, owning a cat can teach
                kids
                social skills and help them cope with traumatic situations. Don't be fooled by all the fluff and
                fur,
                cats
                are natural predators. Despite being domesticated, they still have that hunter instinct and will
                keep
                your
                home free of mice.
            </p>
            <p>In a study of self-proclaimed dog-lovers versus cat-lovers done at Carroll University in Waukesha,
                Wisconsin, cat owners scored higher on intelligence than dog owners did. Cats do sleep a lot, but
                even
                when
                they're snoozing, they still stay super alert. They're actively hearing and smelling things while
                asleep, so
                that they're able to pounce on a pest at a moment's notice. Plenty of apartments allow cats because
                they’re
                quiet, so they are less likely to wake the neighbors up when someone rings your doorbell. Unlike our
                friend
                Fido, Whiskers doesn't require multiple walks a day. Older cats can also be left alone for a day or
                two
                if
                they have access to their food, water, and litter box. Of course, make sure you speak with your
                veterinarian
                beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>Ever wonder why cats love to play? Since they don't hunt for their food, it's believed kitties have
                an
                abundance of energy stored up and release it through playtime. Cats are a lot smarter than people
                make
                them
                out to be. According to Animal Planet, cats are constantly learning and have an excellent memory.
                When
                you
                head off to work and need to leave your pet behind, you may start to feel a little guilty. But it
                might
                be
                easier with a cat who loves having the house to themselves. Cats will sleep whenever they’re bored
                about
                15 hours a day.
            </p>
            <p>Since cats don’t eat nearly as much meat as dogs do, it results in a much smaller carbon footprint.
                While
                definitely smaller, both animals have carbon footprints equivalent to cars, according to some
                sustainability
                authors. A study found that cats drink water "gracefully," so if you have misophonia a.k.a. you hate
                the
                sound of chewing (and/or drinking), you may want to get a cat. Research shows cats can help lower
                your
                blood
                pressure and reduce the risk of dying from a heart attack. It's amazing knowing that one of these
                cuties
                is
                keeping you healthy. Not only is purring absolutely adorable, but it can also be a soothing sound
                for
                humans. In fact, there are numerous online videos of cats just purring to help people fall asleep.

                Egyptian history shows that cats worked hard to be welcomed into homes. But people eventually noticed
                that
                the animals resembled Bast, the Ancient Egyptian goddess of warfare, and they started to be held in
                high
                regard. There are few things in life more heartbreaking than losing a pet, which is why knowing that
                the
                average domestic cat has an average lifespan of about 15 years is quite comforting.
